1. Download the Excel Data File and Load It into Excel
Begin by downloading the relevant coffee sales data file, ensuring all necessary sheets (Orders, Customers, Products) are available. Open it in Excel for analysis.
2. Use XLOOKUP and INDEXMATCH Formulas
Use XLOOKUP or INDEXMATCH to bring in data from other sheets ( Customer or Product ) into the Orders sheet.
3. Calculate Sales
Formula: =Quantity * Unit Price
Add this formula as a new column in the Orders sheet to track the total sales for each order.
4. Data Formatting
Format the data to ensure consistency and clarity:
Date Format: Ensure that the order dates are uniformly formatted (e.g., DD/MM/YYYY or MM/DD/YYYY).
Currency Format: Format the Sales and Unit Price columns as currency to improve readability.
Number Format: Format quantities and other relevant numerical fields to display correctly, possibly with thousand separators or decimals where necessary.
5. Check for and Delete Duplicates
Check for duplicate entries to ensure data integrity.
6. Convert Range to Table (Orders Sheet)
Convert your Orders range to an official Excel Table using Ctrl + T. This improves data organization and allows for dynamic updates.
7. Add Pivot Tables and Pivot Charts
Use the Insert â†’ PivotTable option to create Pivot Tables based on the Orders Table.
Add Pivot Charts for each Pivot Table to visualize the data effectively, such as bar charts for sales comparisons, line charts for trends, and pie charts for customer segments.
8. Insert Timeline and Slicers
Timeline: Add a timeline filter for the Order Date so users can easily filter sales by specific time periods (e.g., months, quarters, or years).
Slicers: Insert Slicers for fields like coffee Type. This allows users to dynamically filter the data in real-time with easy-to-use buttons.
9. Build the Dashboard
Arrange the Pivot Charts, Slicers, and Timeline in a visually appealing layout to create the dashboard.

Final Touch: Polish and Present
After putting together all the components, review the dashboard for consistency and usability. Adjust formatting, layout, and responsiveness to ensure it's easy to understand and navigate. Now, your interactive coffee sales dashboard is ready for presentation and use!

This well-rounded process leads to a professional dashboard with insightful, interactive visualizations.
