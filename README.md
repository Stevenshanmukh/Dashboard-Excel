1. Download the Excel data file and load it into Excel, ensuring all necessary sheets (Orders, Customers, Products) are available. Open it for analysis.

2. Use XLOOKUP or INDEXMATCH to bring in customer or product data from other sheets into the Orders sheet.

3. Calculate sales by adding a new column in the Orders sheet using the formula =Quantity * Unit Price.

4. Format the data for consistency and clarity by standardizing date formats (e.g., DD/MM/YYYY), applying currency format to Sales and Unit Price, and setting number formats with thousand separators or decimals for quantities and other numerical fields.

5. Check for and delete any duplicate entries to maintain data integrity.

6. Convert the Orders range to an Excel table using Ctrl + T to enhance data organization and enable dynamic updates.

7. Create Pivot Tables from the Orders table using the Insert â†’ PivotTable option and add Pivot Charts to visualize the data, such as bar charts for sales comparisons, line charts for trends, and pie charts for customer segments.

8. Insert a timeline for the Order Date to allow filtering by time periods (e.g., months, quarters, or years), and add slicers for fields like Coffee Type to enable real-time filtering.

9. Build the dashboard by arranging the Pivot Charts, Slicers, and Timeline in a visually appealing layout, ensuring an intuitive and polished presentation.
